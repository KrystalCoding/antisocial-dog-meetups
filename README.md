# Shy Dog-Owners Club

Welcome to my first project for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

[Click me](https://krystalcoding.github.io/antisocial-dog-meetups/) to preview my website with fully interactive design.

The Shy Dog-Owners Club is a community site for people in Uppsala, Sweden who own shy or socially anxious dogs. The Club offers different settings for meetups where the owners can mingle while their dogs keep comfortable distance from one another.

Users of this web page will be able to find all the information they need about the club ethos, meeting times and places, pictures for inspiration, and a sign up form to aid in the community organization.

## Features

    - At the top of the pages, the navigation bar displays h1 text on the left side. SHY DOG-OWNERS CLUB on the home page, GET SOCIAL on the images page, and SIGN UP FOR MEETUPS on the sign-up page all link to the top of the home page.
    - At the top of the pages, the navigation bar shows other navigation links on the right side. Home, Images, Sign Up all link to their associated sections on the same site.
